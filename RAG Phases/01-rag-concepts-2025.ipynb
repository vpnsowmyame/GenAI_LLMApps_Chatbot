    "\n",
    "Imagine you're writing a research paper and you have:\n",
    "- **Your brain** (the AI model) - contains general knowledge\n",
    "- **A vast library** (your knowledge base) - contains specific, detailed information\n",
    "- **A librarian** (the retrieval system) - finds relevant books/documents for your question\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question:\n",
    "1. The **librarian** searches the library and brings you the most relevant books\n",
    "2. You **read those books** along with using your existing knowledge\n",
    "3. You **write a comprehensive answer** based on both sources\n",

    "- AI models are trained on data up to a certain date\n",

    "- Example: A model trained in 2023 won't know about 2024 events\n",

    "**2. Hallucination**\n",
    "- AI models sometimes \"make up\" information that sounds plausible but is wrong\n",
    "- They can't distinguish between what they \"know\" and what they're guessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. No Access to Private Data**\n",
    "- AI models can't access your company documents, personal files, or proprietary information\n",
    "- They only know what was in their training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Lack of Source Attribution**\n",
